# Soundroid
Android Project for ESIPE INFO2.

The purpose of this project is to create a Music Player App for Android devices.

## Functionalities

### Indexing

Soundroid can search for the musics stored in the device, and index them into a persistent database. 
Songs can be organize in playlists.
By default, every song is added to :
  - __a "main" playlist__ : all the songs found in the device
  - __an artist playlist__ : all the songs from a specific artist
  - __an album playlist__ : all the songs from a specific album

### Music Player

Soundroid can start a background service to play the songs that have been indexed.

### Search

Soundroid allows to make simple searchs (song name, artist, album) into the songs that have been indexed.
